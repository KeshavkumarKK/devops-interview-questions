1. Tell me about yourself ?

- I’m an AWS-focused DevOps Engineer with about 2 years of hands-on experience building and automating cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized deployments.

I started my career at Rooman Technology as a Junior Cloud Engineer, where I worked extensively on AWS—EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, CloudFront, VPC, and IAM—using Terraform and Kubernetes to remove manual provisioning and improve availability.

I built Jenkins and GitHub Actions pipelines for containerized applications, enabling zero-downtime deployments and reducing deployment time by nearly 50%. I also implemented full observability using CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK, which significantly improved incident detection and reduced MTTR.

Alongside my full-time role, I’ve been working as a freelance DevOps engineer, designing production-grade cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes deployments for real clients, including e-commerce and booking platforms.

Currently, I’m looking for a DevOps role where I can work on scalable SaaS infrastructure, automation, and reliability—exactly the kind of problems Pincodekart and similar product teams face.



simple, calm, interview-friendly intro


I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Science in 2023. After college, I joined Rooman Technology as a Junior Cloud Engineer, where I worked on AWS infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized deployments using tools like Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions. Along with this role, I also handled monitoring, basic security, and production support. In parallel, I worked on freelance DevOps projects, which gave me exposure to real production setups. Currently, I’m looking for a DevOps role where I can continue working on automation, cloud infrastructure, and system reliability.

What was your role and responsibility in your previous company?

Strong answer:

In my previous role at Rooman Technology, I worked as a Junior Cloud / DevOps Engineer, where my primary responsibility was to design, automate, and support cloud infrastructure and deployment pipelines.

I was responsible for provisioning and managing AWS infrastructure using Terraform, including EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, VPC, IAM, and CloudFront. A key part of my role was eliminating manual setup and ensuring infrastructure was consistent across environments.

I built and maintained CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions for containerized applications, enabling zero-downtime deployments and significantly reducing deployment time.

I also handled containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes, along with monitoring and logging using CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK to improve system reliability and reduce incident response time.

From a security and operations perspective, I implemented IAM best practices, secure networking, and supported incident resolution and production issues.

Overall, my role involved end-to-end ownership—from infrastructure provisioning and deployment automation to monitoring, troubleshooting, and continuous improvement.



tight, short version you can deliver in 20–25 seconds:

At Rooman Technology, I worked as a Junior Cloud/DevOps Engineer. My role focused on automating AWS infrastructure using Terraform, building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and deploying containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes. I also handled monitoring, logging, security best practices, and supported production issues to ensure system reliability and smooth deployments.



One-line version (if they push you to be brief):

I was responsible for automating AWS infrastructure, building CI/CD pipelines, managing containerized deployments, and ensuring reliability, security, and observability of production systems.


Why should we hire you?

You should hire me because I have hands-on experience building and supporting real production DevOps systems, not just theoretical knowledge.

I’ve worked on AWS infrastructure, CI/CD automation, Docker and Kubernetes deployments, and monitoring in both a company environment and freelance projects. I understand how to reduce manual work, ship changes safely, and keep systems stable.

I’m comfortable taking ownership, learning quickly, and supporting production when things go wrong. I’m looking for a long-term role where I can contribute consistently and grow with the team.


Shorter 10-second version (if they interrupt):

I have practical DevOps experience, I can automate and support production systems, and I take ownership instead of just setting things up and walking away


why are you looking for job change?

I’m looking for a change because I want to work in a role with deeper ownership and exposure to scalable, long-term DevOps systems.

In my previous role, I built a strong foundation in AWS, CI/CD, automation, and production support. Now I’m looking for an environment where I can apply these skills on more complex, high-impact systems, learn from experienced teams, and grow as a DevOps engineer.

This role aligns well with the kind of work I want to focus on—automation, reliability, and cloud infrastructure—so it feels like the right next step.


Very short HR version (1 line):

I’m looking for growth and broader exposure to scalable DevOps systems that match my current skill set.

How to answer if they push on salary or stability

Safe, flexible answer (recommended)

I’m looking for a fair market-aligned salary based on my skills and responsibilities of the role. My priority is the work, learning, and long-term growth. If the role is a good fit, I’m open to discussing numbers.


If they say: “Your expectation is high”

I understand. I’m open to discussion and happy to align if the role offers good learning, ownership, and stability.


If they push on stability / frequent changes
Best answer (clean + honest)

I’m not changing because of instability. My previous role gave me a solid foundation, and now I’m intentionally looking for a long-term opportunity where I can grow and contribute consistently.

If they say: “How do we know you won’t leave soon?”

My goal is stability. I’m specifically looking for a role where I can stay long term, take ownership, and grow with the company. I’m not exploring multiple short-term switches.

If they push harder (stress interview)

I prefer fewer, meaningful role changes. That’s why I’m being selective and applying only to roles that align well with my skills and long-term goals.


Reason of living pervious company?


Best neutral answer (recommended)

I completed my responsibilities there and felt it was the right time to move on to a role with stronger growth opportunities and a clearer long-term path.

Slightly skill-focused version

I completed my responsibilities there and now I’m looking for a role that offers more learning, ownership, and long-term growth aligned with my skills.

Very short HR version

I completed my responsibilities there and am now looking for better growth opportunities.
